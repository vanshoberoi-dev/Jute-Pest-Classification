## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Model Size Optimization

For faster loading times, you can create optimized model versions

1. TensorFlow Lite Conversion (Recommended)
   ```bash
   python convert_to_tflite.py
   ```
   - Reduces model size by 50-80%
   - Faster loading and inference
   - Maintains high accuracy

2. Model Compression
   ```bash
   python optimize_model.py
   ```
   - Creates optimized SavedModel
   - Better memory efficiency

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

 Issue  Solution 
-----------------
 Model loading fails  Ensure `my_saved_bit_model` contains all files 
 Slow first load  Normal behavior - subsequent loads are cached 
 Low accuracy  Use clear, well-lit images with visible pests 
 Memory errors  Ensure 4GB+ RAM available 
 Import errors  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

### Model File
The optimized model file
```
jute_pest_model.tflite    # 42MB TensorFlow Lite model
```

### Model Conversion

The TFLite model was converted from the original BiT model for optimal deployment

1. Original training See `JP.ipynb` notebook
2. Model conversion Converted to TensorFlow Lite format
3. Optimization Quantized for smaller size and faster inference

### API Integration

The core prediction function can be used independently

```python
from app import load_model, preprocess_image, predict_pest

# Load model once
model = load_model()

# Predict on new image
image_array = preprocess_image(your_image)
pred_idx, confidence, probabilities = predict_pest(model, image_array)
```

## 📊 Dataset Information

- Total Images Varies by class
- Image Resolution 512×512 pixels
- Format RGB color images
- Split TrainValidationTest
- Augmentation Rotation, flip, zoom, brightness
